        Project: tree view
        Project -> overview: recent activity should be accurate
        Project -> documents: there should be some sort of view functionality for records
        Project -> documents: the tab heading lists a count of documents including duplicates, it should list a count of the unique documents
        Project -> timeline: there are duplicate events in the timeline, events should be listed as a family event if over three persons are attached to it, otherwise it should list the attached persons separated by commas. An event should only appear once on the timeline
        Project -> family members: validation fails for birth and death date when omitted even though they are optional fields. Birth date should be required and death date optional
        Project -> family members: create and edit person modal should allow for creating and editing relationships
        Project -> family members: add and edit events in create and edit modal is broken
        Project -> family members: add and edit documents in create and edit modal is broken
        Project -> family members: adding birth date and death date in the biographical info should create birth and death events automatically, and vice versa. In the same form submission, the biographical info and events can both be set for birth and death, but the info must not conflict
