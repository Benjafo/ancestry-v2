        <task>The previous tasks have been completed, let's move on. Using your knowledge of the
            codebase, please address the following problem. We need a way for the manager to add
            existing documents to specific persons. <problem>created or associated documents do not
            appear in edit person modal until whole modal is saved. For example, I will open the
                edit person modal, add a document, and click save. I do not see the document in the
            list, but then if I save the user, close the modal and reopen it, I see it then.</problem>
            Please create a high level overview of how you would functionally implement this task.</task>

        <task>Now provide a more detailed guide of specifically what you would to to implement the
            overview from subtask 1. Do not include ambiguity, including "e.g.", "optional", or any
            non-direct steps.</task>

        <task>Create a file plans/<task_name>fix_view_before_save_issue</task_name>.xml, in which
            I'd like you to reformat the steps from subtask 2 into XML format in a way that an LLM
            can easily understand.</task>
