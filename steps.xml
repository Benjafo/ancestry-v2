        <task>The previous tasks have been completed, let's move on. Using your knowledge of the
            codebase, please address the following problem. We need a way for the manager to add
            existing documents to specific persons. <problem>Adding birth date and death date in the
            biographical info should create birth and death events automatically, and vice versa. In
            the same form submission, the biographical info and events can both be set for birth and
            death, but the info must not conflict. Attempting to add a birth or death event that has
            a date conflicting with the biographical information should not work. For example, when
            I create a person, I should be able to manually add a birth date (required), and go to
            the events tab and add a death event, and when I save the modal, I should see the birth
            and death dates on the biographical information tab. Also, in that example scenario, I
            could have added BOTH a death date in biographical information and a death event, as
            long as the dates for both of them were the same.</problem> Please create a high level
            overview of how you would functionally implement this task.</task>

        <task>Now provide a more detailed guide of specifically what you would to to implement the
            overview from subtask 1. Do not include ambiguity, including "e.g.", "optional", or any
            non-direct steps.</task>

        <task>Create a file plans/<task_name>birth_death_date_events</task_name>.xml, in which I'd like you to
            reformat the steps from subtask 2 into XML format in a way that an LLM can easily
            understand.</task>
